# Favorite Quotes
   1. To be a successful creator you don't need millions. You don't need millions of dollars or millions of customers, millions of clients or millions of fans. To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true fans. — kk.org



# ChatGpt Prompts
## 1. Prompt 1: Creating the Perfect Bio

   A good bio describes your personality, interests, and mission to people who visit your profile. 
   For them to click follow it needs to be very refined and compelling. Your goal is to drive people to 
   your page and click follow.

   Before using this prompt, you need to identify 10 different influencers from your niche creating content
   that interests you. Copy their bios & put them into this prompt and let ChatGPT do the work.
      
  ```js
       Prompt: "I create content related to [YOUR NICHE INFO] on X. I want you to write a professional bio for my profile.
       Here are some examples of bios that you can take as an example when creating my bio [COPY AND PASTE THE BIOS].
       Brainstorm 10 potential bios tailored to me using the given examples as an inspiration for style and ideas."
   
  ````
   You can pick any one from the 10 ideas and ask ChatGPT to remove or add any info.


## 2. Prompt 2: Repurposing Content

   Creating original content is hard and time-consuming in this fast-paced world. But, that's where ChatGPT can help you the most.
   Find long-form articles or videos related to your niche.

  Paste them into this high-value prompt and ChatGPT will do the rest.

  PS: If you're using videos, first get a whole summary of it using any extension or the Bing sidebar.

   ```js
     Prompt: "I found this nice article [Paste the whole article].
     Turn this article into 3 different Twitter threads of each [Desired length] taking the best pieces out of it.

   ```
## Prompt 3: Quote Tweets

Many people don't know this but quote-tweeting an already popular tweet will show it to many others and 
will also help you build networks.

But what comments you make matters the most.

This prompt will help you brainstorm comments for quote tweets.

```js
Prompt: "I found this tweet [Paste the tweet] that is doing well. I would like to retweet it with my views.
Brainstorm 5 possible comments I can make to it.
``` 

## Prompt 4: Replying to Comments

Once your tweets start getting engagement, people will comment their views, questions, etc. 
Replying to them is a must as that's how you build trust with your existing audience and grow. 
But most people seem to not know how to reply to tweets. 
This prompt will help you brainstorm replies.

```js
Prompt: "I posted this [The tweet you put out] on my Twitter page related to [Insert your page info].
A guy commented on it saying [Paste the comment].
Brainstorm 10 [Tone of the reply (optional)] replies that I can give to him.
